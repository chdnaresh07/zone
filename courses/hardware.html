<p><font color="blue">Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and 
computer science required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers usually have training in electronic engineering 
(or electrical engineering), software design, and hardware-software integration instead of only software engineering or electronic engineering. 
Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, 
personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. <br>
This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture.
